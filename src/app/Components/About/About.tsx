          I'm Fauzan Sulthoni, a full stack developer with over 7 years of
          experience in education, where I worked as a teacher and
          administrative staff at PMDG. My background includes student data
          management, IT network administration, document archiving, and
          internal web app development.

          After graduating from University of Darussalam Gontor in 2023 and
          completing my service in 2025, I shifted my focus to web development.
          Through self-learning and online courses from FreeCodeCamp, Iâ€™ve built
          a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies. Now, I
          actively build personal projects to deepen my understanding of modern
          web architecture, UI design, and scalable systems.
